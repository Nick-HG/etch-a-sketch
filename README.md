# etch-a-sketch

This project was to create a board which allows the user to create any drawing they choose. They have predefined choices for color input, namely black, white, and random and are able to define a board size of up to 100x100 with 32x32 being the preset. 

There is also a reset button which allows the user to start over again. 

This project allowed me to expand my scope of vanilla JavaScript, creating different functions to allow the project to work properly. It also gave me scope to learn a few more tricks with CSS including filter and transition which I used on the buttons when hovered.
